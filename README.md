# Automated-Checklist-Process

**Problem Statement** 
The 'Risk and Compliance' team currently performs quality checks using an Excel-based checklist template. While functional, this approach presents several limitations:
Lack of Flexibility: Adding or removing checklist items requires manual updates to the Excel template, which must then be redistributed to all auditors to ensure consistency.
Version Control Issues: Ensuring every auditor is using the latest version of the checklist is difficult, leading to potential discrepancies in audits.
Reporting Challenges: Once completed checklists are submitted to a shared folder, aggregating and analyzing results becomes cumbersome and time-consuming.

**Proposed Solution**
A more robust and scalable solution is needed to address these issues. Ideally, this solution should:
Allow dynamic updates to the checklist without manual redistribution.
Ensure version control and consistency across all users.
Enable centralized data collection and automated reporting for better insights and efficiency.
